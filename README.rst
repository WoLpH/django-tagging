Django Tagging
==============

This is a generic tagging application for Django projects

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.

This is a fork of the Django Tagging project which seems to be completely
inactive.

The original Django Tagging project has some serious performance
issues with large datasets. This fork will fix all features I currently need.
But if other people have issues than I will try to fix those aswell if time
allows me.
